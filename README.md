# Kinoteka_HCI

This project is created for Human Computer Interaction class on FESB (Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture in Split) and it is supposed to be a movie streaming website created using GatsbyJS, a React-based framework. It was work on in collaboration with Marko VujnoviÄ‡ and can be found on his profile (https://github.com/Vujo33666/HCI-project) too. However everything uploaded here is done by me, as he did later stages of the project.

The project started with a low fidelity design which was drawn on paper and can be found in "lowFidelity" folder.

Following that design, with some modifications, the project continued with a high fidelity design which was done in figma and can be found in "highFidelity" folder as well as here "https://www.figma.com/file/ym8SZIj4Ry6UoQtrDqQOFJ/HCI_Project?node-id=10%3A9".

Current progress of the page can be viewed at "https://kinoteka.netlify.app/".
